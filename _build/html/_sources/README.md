# Notes

- Maybe for all workshops, let's try to force images/files created by the code in a specific folder in main folder (for example, an image produced should be directed to ./images and should not be produced and left in the main folder - see Day-1.Rmd vs Day-2.Rmd)


# Current Status
Almost Done, pretty much everything implemented
- [ ] double check everything is formatted correctly and works ?
- [ ] fix small bugs (below)

## Current Bugs
- Primary sidebar toggle button does not work well (the way it works defeats its point)
- To-do list markdown not formatting correctly
